			  The concept of Weekday Vegetarian is to guide people who are looking to scale back on meat but don't know where to begin. Most of us become interested in vegetarian eating because we want to cut back on meat, omit meat, or do our part to help minimize the environmental impact caused by the production of meat. Another huge draw that is often overlooked is what a vegetarian-based meal <i>adds</i> to the table. Once you see how easy it is to use vegetables as a starting point, you'll realize it's also extremely liberating.
